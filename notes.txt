#create sveltekit directory from desktop
npm init svelte <directory name>

cd <directory name>
npm install
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"
npm run dev -- --open

# can clean up the default stuff to start out with a clean slate
# deleted everything except app.css , app.html , and routes folder
# created components folder
# added back in an empty __layout.svelte

# this seems like a good starting point?
